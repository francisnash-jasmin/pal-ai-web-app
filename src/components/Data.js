Apples grow best where there is cold in winter, moderate summer temperatures, and medium to high humidity. There are apples for fresh eating, some for cooking, and some for preserving. Some apples are sweet and some are tart. Some apples come to harvest in summer, some in autumn. Apples can grow from 10 to 30 feet tall and nearly as wide. They are moderately fast-growing, but growth slows with age. Apple trees can live for 100 years or more. Apple trees bloom in the spring, set fruit, and take from 100 to 200 days to reach harvest depending upon the variety."

The trunk is leafy, not woody. New leaves grow up from the center of the trunk, pushing older leaves outward. At the base of a banana plant, under the ground, is a big rhizome or corm; this is the plant’s root system. Banana fruits form in late summer. They reach mature size the following spring. When the fruit is green and plump it is nearly ripe; it is then cut off the stalk. The fruit finishes ripening after it is cut from the plant. Mature fingers commonly change color from green to yellow. Plantains, cooking bananas, turn yellow, then brown, then black as they ripen."

During the dry season, the beds are 20 cm high, while during the rainy season, they are 30 cm high. The distance between furrows is 150 cm, and the bed tops are around 90 cm broad. During land preparation, apply 2 to 3 tons of organic fertilizer or compost per hectare. Saluyot can be harvested 30 days after transplanting by harvesting the crop at a height of 20 to 25 cm from the ground. Harvesting is repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for up to 7 months.
